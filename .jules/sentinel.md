## 2024-05-24 - Fix Information Disclosure in try()
**Vulnerability:** `try()` block in `llcont.R` defaulted to `silent = FALSE`, inadvertently leaking internal execution errors (e.g., matrix singularity details) to standard error.
**Learning:** R's `try()` defaults to printing errors unless `silent = TRUE` is explicitly provided.
**Prevention:** Always use `silent = TRUE` inside `try()` blocks or prefer `tryCatch()` to gracefully handle exceptions and prevent information disclosure.

## 2024-05-25 - Fix Information Disclosure in error handling
**Vulnerability:** Error handling in vuongtest used stop with the raw error object, which can expose internal execution details and call stacks.
**Learning:** Re-throwing errors directly propagates the entire condition object including the call, which can leak internal arguments and stack trace details.
**Prevention:** Always use stop with call. = FALSE and a custom generic message to prevent information disclosure.
